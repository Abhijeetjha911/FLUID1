1. Consider the velocity field given by:

рќ‘ў=((рќ‘Ґ2в€’рќ‘¦2в€’1)(рќ‘Ґ2в€’рќ‘¦2)+4рќ‘Ґ2рќ‘¦2)/рќ‘џ4

рќ‘Ј=в€’2рќ‘Ґрќ‘¦/рќ‘џ4

рќ‘џ=рќ‘Ґ2+рќ‘¦2вЂѕвЂѕвЂѕвЂѕвЂѕвЂѕвЂѕв€љ

Further, set рќ‘ў,рќ‘Ј be set to zero when рќ‘џ<1. Plot the velocity field using lines with arrows. Plot the streamlines. also plot path lines and streaklines for 10 points that start from the line x = -2.

What does this flow look like to you?

2. Now consider the velocity field given by:

рќ‘ў=в€’(рќ‘ҐвЂІ2в€’рќ‘¦2)/рќ‘џ4

рќ‘Ј=в€’2рќ‘ҐвЂІрќ‘¦/рќ‘џ4

рќ‘џ=рќ‘ҐвЂІ2+рќ‘¦2вЂѕвЂѕвЂѕвЂѕвЂѕвЂѕвЂѕвЂѕв€љ

рќ‘ҐвЂІ=(рќ‘Ґ+рќ‘Ў)

Note that this is a function of time. Plot the velocity field as before at some chosen times. Compute the pathlines and streaklines for points along the line x=-2, and integrate this system for a total time of 5-6 seconds.

Also, plot the streamlines at a few different times.

What does this flow look like?
